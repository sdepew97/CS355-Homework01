How to compile: There is a Makefile, so just type make to make and clean.

How to run it: run with ./<executable name> and <any parameters>. The programs run as requested in the assignment specifications.

Known Bugs and Limitations: We discussed the alarm issue with microcat. In this instance, when there are characters in the buffer, they print out on the next terminal
line when a signal is received. This is not a bug per-say, but I wanted to document it.
