1. README: There must be a file called README, which contains any helpful information on how to compile and run your program. This includes:
Your name: Sarah Depew
How to compile: You should provide a Makefile and I should just have to type ’make’ to compile your program. You may leave this out if that is indeed so. Any extra work I have to do get the program to compile must be clearly explained there.
How to run it: Explain how to execute your program if it’s not immediately obvious.
Known Bugs and Limitations: List any known bugs, deficiencies, or limitations with re- spect to the project specifications. Documented bugs will receive less deduction versus uncaught ones.
File directory: If you have multiple source files, (other than those created by the compiler), please briefly explain the purpose of each.
